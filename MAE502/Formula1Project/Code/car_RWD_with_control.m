% Rear wheel drive 2D bicycle model with controller.

% The states are 
%      x coordinate
%      y coordinate
%      psi yaw angle
%      sigma longitudinal speed
%      gamma steering angle
% The inputs are 
%      R driving force at rear wheel   
%      gamma_dot time derivative of steering angle
% Car is the structure variable for Car parameters
%%%  By default, the car RWD will give out dX and 10 values for monitoring purpose
%%% They are [R;gamma_dot; tgamma; dtgamma; s0;sf;sr;n0;nf;nr]; at time t
% R driving force. 
% gamma_dot time derivative of steering angle
% tan(gamma), d(tan(gamma))/dt,
% s0 reference to the centerline of the center of mass,
% sf reference to the centerline of the front axle 
% sr reference to the centerline of the rear axle
% n0 distance to the centerline from the center of mass,
% nf distance to the centerline from the front axle 
% nr distance to the centerline from the rear axle
